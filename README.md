# Web 3 Revenue Primitives

<img src='imgs/coins.png'>

*Core primitives* are a set of concepts that are innately understood but cannot be expressed in simpler terms.

This repository is an attempt at list of *web3 revenue primitives*, created by, for, and at [ETHMagicians Prague 2018 by the business models ring](https://hackmd.io/DaJhrasLQteUk3IwX5bQAg?view#8-Business-Models-Ring).

[Notes from Business Models Ring at Eth Magicians, the first session which convened on 2018/10/29, are here](https://hackmd.io/W11KX6Y9R3idXXhN2tHFzA).

## Marketplace Percentage Fee

This model is where you take a % of each transaction on your platform. It is popular with exchanges.

## ICOS

Sell a bunch of ERC20 tokens at once, or during a window of time.

## Continuous Funding Models

Sell a bunch of ERC20 tokens *over time*.

## Streaming Money

### Side Channels:
A sidechain is a separate blockchain that is attached to its parent blockchain(mainchain) using a two-way peg. You can move assets to the sidechain and then back to the parent chain.
Sidechains need their own miners. These miners can be incentivized through ‘merged mining’, whereby two separate cryptocurrencies, based on the same algorithm, are mined simultaneously.
Here is a list of some of the Sidechain Projects:

* [Plasma](http://plasma.io/)
* [Loom](https://loomx.io/)
* [POA](https://poa.network/)
* [Truebit](https://truebit.io/)

### State Channels:
State channels are basically two-way pathways opened between two users that want to communicate with each other in the form of transactions. Here, only the final outcome needs to be included in the form of one single transaction on main chain. Other transaction's are done on off chain. Few know projects around it are:

* [Raiden Network](https://raiden.network/)
* [Machinomy](https://machinomy.com/)
* [FunFair](https://funfair.io/)
* [Liquidity](https://liquidity.network/)
* [Trinity](https://trinity.tech/#/)
* [Celer](https://www.celer.network/)
* [Spankchain](https://spankchain.com/)
* [Connext](https://connext.network/)
* [Counterfactual](https://counterfactual.com/)

## Non Fungible Tokens

Non fungible tokens are tokens that are unique from one another

Famous NFT projects:

* [CryptoKitties](https://medium.com/@codetractio/a-look-into-cryptokitties-revenue-model-6466b705a998)
* [OpenSea NFT marketplace](http://opensea.io)

## Subscriptions

Subscriptions are a recurring exchange of value over time.

* [EIP 1337](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1337)
* [1337 Alliance](https://1337alliance.com)

## Self-Sovereign Identity

Identity Standards Proposals:
* [EIP 725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725)
* [EIP 725 Alliance](https://erc725alliance.org/)
* [EIP 1056](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1056) and [ERC 780](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/780)
* [Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation/)
* [Decentralized Identifiers (DID)](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/)

Projects in the Identity space:
* [uPort](https://uport.me)
* [Civic](https://www.civic.com/)
* [BloomID](https://bloom.co/identity/)
* [TENZ-ID](https://tenzorum.org/tenz_id/)
* [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains)

## Lending

Smart contracts that control credit scores, loan issuance, and interest payments will run on top of protocols like Ethereum. These debt contracts will be hashed into existence and generate hashflow for the lenders. This is a flow of hashflow above the base layer protocol.

* [Dharma Protocol](https://dharma.io/)
* [LoanScan](https://loanscan.io/)

## Curating

The job of a search engine like Google is to collect and curate data from the Internet. This is one of the most valuable curation projects in the world. The key with curation markets is to get all of the incentives aligned so that you can trust the underlying data. The term used in the industry is the Token Curated Registry.
It’s not just about creating a list. It’s about creating a list you can trust by incentivising curators to do the research for you.

* [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com/)
* [Messari](https://messari.io/)

## Creating

The creation of new things on chains will have value. Selling them to people who want them will generate hashflow. Making these unique tokens takes a lot of effort. You have to get a community of people to agree to their value.

* [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/)

## Advertising

There are some options for doing advertising-based business models for open source projects, listed below.

* [CodeFund](http://codefund.app)


## Questionable / Possible Ponzi Schemes

TODO - What else should live here?

* [Fomo3d](https://medium.com/@eetusro/i-note-this-is-fin-e-6646f4a1e55b)


## Staking/Indirect Staking

With the advent of DPoS in main-nets and side-chains like Loom Network, staking will be a bigger way to generate revenue in the future. Right now, the only use cases on the market are service-based staking pools like Rocket Pool. However, in the future, dApp companies could use stake as an option to earn revenue. An example would be a dApp smart contract that accepts Ethereum 2.0's ETH as stake from their users in return for dApp utility tokens, and then these dApp developers can use this pool of user-staked Ether to earn mining rewards from the Ethereum main-net.

* [Rocket Pool](https://www.rocketpool.net/)

## Tipping

The protocol could have a tip method that is called by users. This method mints coins and sends them to the dApp developer which maintains and upgrades the protocol. Pros: Value is generated through protocol upgrades. Minting coins and giving them to the developer is akin to companies giving stock to employees. Cons: Could lead to protocol being very centralized. 

### Rent
